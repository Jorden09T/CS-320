To ensure that my code, program or software is functional and secure I would implement data security protection by an unauthorized user requires proper authentication and authorization. This can be done with a strict password policy and 2-factor authentication. 
I would interpret the user needs and incorporate them into the program by thoroughly reading the users needs and breaking them down to see if they will or will not work with the program. This can be solved by testing and debugging the program, this will reveal which need from the user will be able to work with the program. 
My approach is to first look at the requirements and/or the interview transcipts to make sure I get all of the needed points that the client is looking for within the program. Once the code is written I then go back and make sure it works efficiently. When the testing is finish and the program works with no issues then I consider it done.
